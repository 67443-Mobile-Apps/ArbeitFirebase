67-443: Arbeit (Firebase)
---
This is just a simple task management app using Firebase to store data and handle authentication. There is much more to Firebase and an abundance of documentation and help from Google (and others).  This may not be the right solution for all applications, but it works well for many apps and definitely worth considering.
